Introducing RexBit Chain, the innovative Ethereum layer 2 blockchain poised to transform 
the cryptocurrency landscape. By utilizing the stability, reliability, and scalability of the 
Ethereum blockchain, RexBit aims to create a unique environment that rewards user activity rather 
than solely catering to large holders with minimal activity.

RexBit Chain is the core of RexBit, launching on the Ethereum blockchain allowing for full 
integration into our Layer 2 solution. Coded directly into the RBC token is a newly developed 
blockchain ledger, continuously logging all user activity across both Layer 1 and Layer 2. With 
full integration possible through custom interface access, user activity now becomes a pilar and 
main emphasis versus holding alone. This fully unique ability allows for utilities such as RexBit 
Dividends and RexBit DAO.
