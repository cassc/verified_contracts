contract\r\n *  allowing anyone to easily build a fully permissionless ERC-4626 compliant\r\n *  Vault by inheriting this contract and overriding three simple functions.\r\n\r\n *  It utilizes an immutable proxy pattern that allows the BaseStrategy\r\n *  to remain simple and small.

There are\r\n *  other optional methods that can be implemented to further customize\r\n *  the strategy if desired.\r\n *\r\n *  All default storage for the strategy is controlled and updated by the\r\n *  `TokenizedStrategy`. The implementation holds a storage struct that\r\n *  contains all needed global variables in a manual storage slot. This\r\n *  means strategists can feel free to implement their own custom storage\r\n *  variables as they need with no concern of collisions. All global variables\r\n *  can be viewed within the Strategy by a simple call using the\r\n *  `TokenizedStrategy` variable.
