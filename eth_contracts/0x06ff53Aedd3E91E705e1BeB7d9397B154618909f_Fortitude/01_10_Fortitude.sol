◹◺    A lone person confidently stands their ground amongst the chaos of crashing waves     ◹◺
◹◺    at Shore Acres State Park, Oregon.                                                    ◹◺
◹◺                                                                                          ◹◺
◹◺    In January of 2020 the Oregon Coast experienced an extremely high surf event.         ◹◺
◹◺    While I have witnessed high surf before, the swell height of 28-35 feet is on the     ◹◺
◹◺    extreme side. I took my son down to Shore Acres State Park near Coos Bay so that      ◹◺
◹◺    he, too, could witness the intense power and fury of the ocean.                       ◹◺
◹◺                                                                                          ◹◺
◹◺    Shore Acres is well known for its massive crashing waves. Compression resulting       ◹◺
◹◺    from the collision of the Pacific Oceanic Plate with the western edge of North        ◹◺
◹◺    America forces the rock to angle steeply to the east, creating a rugged set of        ◹◺
◹◺    cliffs just offshore that rise out of the surf to create the shoreline. When          ◹◺
◹◺    combined with high surf swells, the result is thunderous crashes that dramatically    ◹◺
◹◺    send waves hundreds of feet into the air, a raw display of the immense power of       ◹◺
◹◺    nature. Add to that the surrounding geology and the interesting weathering of the     ◹◺
◹◺    rock and it has become one of my favorite places to visit on the coast no matter      ◹◺
◹◺    the conditions.                                                                       ◹◺
◹◺                                                                                          ◹◺
◹◺    Like many of our natural areas, high surf advisories at Shore Acres have become       ◹◺
◹◺    quite the draw to nature lovers and photographers. Watching the waves becomes         ◹◺
◹◺    addicting, always waiting for the next big one that will be bigger than the last      ◹◺
◹◺    big one, which was the biggest of them all. The thunderous boom and explosion of      ◹◺
◹◺    water is invigorating, especially for those who venture closer to the wave action,    ◹◺
◹◺    with the water and spray raining down onto the viewing area. It’s quite rare to       ◹◺
◹◺    find a place that puts you so close to the action yet keeps you safe. This is one     ◹◺
◹◺    of the major draws of Shore Acres State Park: the intensity and adventure without     ◹◺
◹◺    the danger.                                                                           ◹◺
◹◺                                                                                          ◹◺
◹◺    The main attraction is the rock shelf to the north of the main observation deck.      ◹◺
◹◺    This is where “THE” wave happens. If there’s ever an image that you’ve seen of        ◹◺
◹◺    Shore Acres it’s likely been of that specific rock shelf and a crashing wave.         ◹◺
◹◺    However, the rest of the shoreline offers up a variety of cliffs all interacting      ◹◺
◹◺    with the high surf, and in my opinion, offering up a more dynamic scene with waves    ◹◺
◹◺    crashing their way into the numerous coves. While I have hundreds of images from      ◹◺
◹◺    other days where I, too, had pointed towards the north, on this day the way the       ◹◺
◹◺    midday light backlit the mist and crashing waves when pointed to the south was        ◹◺
◹◺    hard to tear myself away from. I got lost in my viewfinder with these waves and       ◹◺
◹◺    this scene, huddled under my umbrella behind a parapet to shield myself from the      ◹◺
◹◺    deluge of crashing waves and ocean mist.                                              ◹◺
◹◺                                                                                          ◹◺
◹◺    Nature has always offered me inspiration, perspective, solace, and reprieve and       ◹◺
◹◺    I often find metaphors for life in my photos. This photo is yet another example of    ◹◺
◹◺    that for me. It gives me hope that I can confidently stand amongst the crashing       ◹◺
◹◺    waves of life and come out clean on the other side. It’s these moments in nature      ◹◺
◹◺    that I am drawn to the most.. the moments and scenes that touch me in an              ◹◺
◹◺    introspective way, and it’s those moments that I try to capture in a bottle.          ◹◺
◹◺                                                                                          ◹◺
