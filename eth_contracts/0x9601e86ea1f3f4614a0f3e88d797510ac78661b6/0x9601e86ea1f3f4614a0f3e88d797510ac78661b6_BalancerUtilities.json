If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated\\n    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended\\n    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at\\n    // the final intended token.\\n    //\\n    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal\\n    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes\\n    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost\\n    // much less gas than they would otherwise.\\n    //\\n    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple\\n    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only\\n    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).\\n    //\\n    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token\\n    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the\\n    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.\\n    //\\n    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after\\n    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).\\n    //\\n    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do\\n    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be\\n    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address.
