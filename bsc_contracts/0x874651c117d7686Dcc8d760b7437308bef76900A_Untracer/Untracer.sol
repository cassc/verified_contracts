 * Multi Amount Version, with 0,1Eth - 0,5Eth - 1Eth
 * 
 * This smart contract provides anonymous transactions through the use of asymmetric encryption. When a user wants to make a transaction,
 * they send an amount to the contract and press a button to generate a password based on the asymmetric encryption protocol. 
 * The password is recorded off-chain in a secure manner so that no one can read it.
 * The user then enters the password and presses the deposit commit button to register the transaction. At this point, the contract knows 
 * a password associated with the funds and anyone, even from another wallet, can withdraw the funds as long as they know the private key 
 * of the generated password. No one can stop the withdrawals or modify the minimum withdrawal and deposit amount openly.
 * The contract does not have a owner and the only thing that can be changed by the person who coded it is the tax collector wallet and 
 * the amount of fees deposited in the contract, which is selectable from 4 fixed options.

 *
* To use the service, the user must deposit a fixed amount of ETH, either 0.1, 0.5, or 1 ETH, using the DEPOSIT method. 
* To generate a password hash, the user needs to choose a personal password of at least 18 characters, keep it secret, and click the Generate button in the READ section. 
* The password hash generated should be inserted into the WRITE -> Deposit page, along with the desired amount, which should be one of the three previously mentioned 
* amounts, and decimal points should be separated by a period and not a comma. The user should also enter a secret magic number between 1 and 99 and click the 
* DEPOSIT button, followed by confirmation from their wallet.
* 
* When the user wishes to withdraw, they must wait for at least five minutes to ensure the safety and breakage of the chain. 
* Then, they should go to the WRITE section and connect with a NEW wallet, never used before and devoid of transactions, using WEB3 connect. 
* The user should then click on the MAGIC NUMBER button, enter the number they used for the deposit, and confirm the transaction. 
* This will result in a number of KEY tokens being deposited equal to the number chosen. After completing this operation, the user should go to 
* the Withdraw button and enter the secret password they chose at the time of the deposit, not the hash code. 
* The chosen amount will be transferred to the new wallet with a complete chain break.
* 
* HOW TO:
* 
* From the starting wallet:

* [ Read contract section] on Etherscan -> GENERATE.
* Enter an 18-character password.
* [ Write contract section] on Etherscan -> Deposit
* Connect with the OLD WALLET using the (Connect to Web3) button.
* Enter the amount using a period for decimal points and not a comma.
* Enter the HASH code generated from the previous step (not the password but its hash).
* Enter a number between 1 and 99.
* Keep in mind that forgetting the magic number or password code will result in the loss of funds.
* Click the DEPOSIT button. The wallet will open, and a transaction will be completed.
* 
* When the user wishes to withdraw:
* Obtain a new and clean wallet.
* Connect using the (Connect to Web3) button with the new wallet.
* Click the MAGIC NUMBER button, entering the number chosen at the time of the deposit.
* A transaction will take place, and a cryptographic key will be inserted into the wallet, protecting against MEV bots.
* Select the WITHDRAW button and enter the password chosen at the time of the deposit (not the hash code but the clear password).
* A transaction will deposit completely untraceable ETH to the new wallet.
* 
* Note that to use this service, the user must possess project tokens. Contact the relevant project owners to determine the minimum number of tokens required to operate the mixer.
* 
* User must use only: 
* 
* -> GENERATE (to create hash from password)
* -> DEPOSIT (to commit a deposit)
* -> MAGIC NUMBER (to send to destination wallet the security token)
* -> WITHDRAW (to take funds back from contrac)
