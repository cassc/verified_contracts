contract TestTradeV4 is TradeV4 {
    // Though the TradeV4 contract is upgradeable, we still have to initialize the implementation through the
    // constructor. This is because we chose to import the non upgradeable EIP712 as it does not have storage
    // variable(which actually makes it upgradeable) as it only uses immmutable variables. This has several advantages:
    // - We can import it without worrying the storage layout
    // - Is more efficient as there is no need to read from the storage
    // Note: The cache mechanism will NOT be used here as the address will differ from the one calculated in the
    // constructor due to the fact that when the contract is operating we will be using delegatecall, meaningn
    // that the address will be the one from the proxy as opposed to the implementation's during the
    // constructor execution
