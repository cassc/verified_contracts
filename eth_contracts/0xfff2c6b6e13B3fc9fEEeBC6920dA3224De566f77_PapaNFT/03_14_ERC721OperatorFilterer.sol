 *         Adding the onlyAllowedOperator modifier to the transferFrom and both safeTransferFrom methods ensures that
 *         the msg.sender (operator) is allowed by the OperatorFilterRegistry. Adding the onlyAllowedOperatorApproval
 *         modifier to the approval methods ensures that owners do not approve operators that are not allowed.
