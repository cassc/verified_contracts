 * @notice These are the parameters that will remain constant between the

 * @property to - The account that receives funds, in the event of a crosschain call,
 * will receive funds if the call fails.
 *
 * @param originDomain - The originating domain (i.e. where `xcall` is called). Must match nomad domain schema
 * @param destinationDomain - The final domain (i.e. where `execute` / `reconcile` are called). Must match nomad domain schema
 * @param canonicalDomain - The canonical domain of the asset you are bridging
 * @param to - The address you are sending funds (and potentially data) to
 * @param delegate - An address who can execute txs on behalf of `to`, in addition to allowing relayers
 * @param receiveLocal - If true, will use the local nomad asset on the destination instead of adopted.
 * @param callData - The data to execute on the receiving chain. If no crosschain call is needed, then leave empty.
 * @param slippage - Slippage user is willing to accept from original amount in expressed in BPS (i.e. if
 * a user takes 1% slippage, this is expressed as 1_000)
 * @param originSender - The msg.sender of the xcall
 * @param bridgedAmt - The amount sent over the bridge (after potential AMM on xcall)
 * @param normalizedIn - The amount sent to `xcall`, normalized to 18 decimals
 * @param nonce - The nonce on the origin domain used to ensure the transferIds are unique
 * @param canonicalId - The unique identifier of the canonical token corresponding to bridge assets
