     * This constant indicates precision of storing compact balances in the storage or floating point. Since default
     * balance precision is 256 bits it might gain some overhead on the storage because we don't need to store such huge
     * amount range. That is why we compact balances in uint112 values instead of uint256. By managing this value
     * you can set the precision of your balances, aka min and max possible staking amount. This value depends
     * mostly on your asset price in USD, for example ETH costs 4000$ then if we use 1 ether precision it takes 4000$
     * as min amount that might be problematic for users to do the stake. We can set 1 gwei precision and in this case
     * we increase min staking amount in 1e9 times, but also decreases max staking amount or total amount of staked assets.
     *
     * Here is an universal formula, if your asset is cheap in USD equivalent, like ~1$, then use 1 ether precision,
     * otherwise it might be better to use 1 gwei precision or any other amount that your want.
     *
     * Also be careful with setting `minValidatorStakeAmount` and `minStakingAmount`, because these values has
     * the same precision as specified here. It means that if you set precision 1 ether, then min staking amount of 10
     * tokens should have 10 raw value. For 1 gwei precision 10 tokens min amount should be stored as 10000000000.
     *
     * For the 112 bits we have ~32 decimals lg(2**112)=33.71 (lets round to 32 for simplicity). We split this amount
     * into integer (24) and for fractional (8) parts. It means that we can have only 8 decimals after zero.
     *
     * Based in current params we have next min/max values:
     * - min staking amount: 0.00000001 or 1e-8
     * - max staking amount: 1000000000000000000000000 or 1e+24
     *
     * WARNING: precision must be a 1eN format (A=1, N>0)
