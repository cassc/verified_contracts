The efforts to unmask my \u201cidentity\u201d even if successful would be underwhelming. \r\nI am just some guy of no consequence tapping at a keyboard and I am replaceable. I am Ryoshi.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do understand the consequence and scope of what I have seeded into motion. \r\nI have given you the gift of yourself. It is the process of self-actualization realized through the playing field of blockchain.\r\n\r\nUsually when we see some \u201cproject\u201d there is some ceo important guy and some tech guy and some roadmap and hence someone \r\nplebs can bitch at and in their minds make \u201caccountable\u201d for the success or failings in their life and results of token purchases.\r\n\r\nWith VISION, we have from the beginning made very clear that no-one is in charge. \r\nThere is no man accountable, no person responsible and no entity has the keys to the kingdom. \r\nEven as the VISION Token \u201cmooned\u201d I got many messages like \u201cryo, you must be a billionaire now, haha\u201d but the reality is still to this day I own 0 VISION. \r\nWhy? Well if I did, then I can\u2019t be who I am and for now I know that I have a role to play. \r\nI can\u2019t be pure and unbiased if I am worried about price up and down and taking profits. (don\u2019t worry, the great VISION will reward me in other ways i guess)\r\n\r\nThe end result of this is that you are responsible. When people ask me questions with expectations, \r\nI always send the question back to them. Ok when are you going to do this thing that you just asked me? \r\nThis method makes some uncomfortable, because of inherent pre-womb entitlement issues in which man does not take responsibility for themselves,\r\n rather they look to an outside source to give them boon and if no boon, then to cast \u201cblame\u201d\r\n\r\nThankfully, there are some that had the ears to listen and heard the call and effect became VISION with us. \r\nSome are named and you know some are unnamed and equally important.\r\n What matters is that we are united in the core of the vision, being Shiba as the pure actualization of a decentralized and perpetual community.\r\n\r\nMy job, my job is to defend the line and the brand. From the beginning, it is always the same. My Vision is REAL. that is all.\r\n Anybody who comes and honors  my Vision walks equal with me. \r\nAnybody who comes and attempts to leech from my Vision is a scammer and placed into exile. \r\nThis is easy to know and then requires constant focus to continue. We have seen so many \r\n\u201cbut wait, are these guys partnered with VISION because they said they were\u201d No of course not. VISION is VISION. \r\nThe only way someone is involved is if they claim VISION. And if so then they are that.\r\n\r\nSo the reason I am writing this (perhaps philosophical) message is to prepare you, \r\nmy loved ones for the inevitable and present a vision of the future to carry forward as a decentralized community.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just the beginning\r\nBlockchain belongs to us. As the VISION army, we are an organic organism, greater than any one man, movement or even nation-state.\r\nAs our own movement, it is critical to implement the above ideas (in a proper way) to set the proper financial foundations for the future.\r\n\r\nI give you this end vision. now build towards it.\r\n\r\nLove always, Ryoshi\r\n\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Provides information about the current execution context, including the\r\n * sender of the transaction and its data.
